Overview of Instance
=======================

Zergaw CloudStack provides several guest management operations for 
end Users and administrators. Instances may be stopped, started, 
rebooted, and destroyed.

Guest Instance can have two names for use in different contexts. 

-  Display name – the name displayed in the CloudStack web UI. Can be
   set by the User. Defaults to Instance name.

-  Name – host name that the DHCP server assigns to the Instance. Can be set
   by the User. Defaults to Instance name

Guest Instances can be configured to be Highly Available (HA). An HA-enabled
Instance is monitored by the system. If the system detects that the Instance is
down, it will attempt to restart the Instance, possibly on a different host.

Each new Instance is allocated a private IP address from the address pool that is defined
on the Guest Network or VPC Tier. If needed a static NAT between the public IP address 
and the private address of the Instace can be configured.

Zergaw CloudStack cannot distinguish a guest Instance that was shut down by the User
(such as with the “shutdown” command in Linux) from an Instance that shut down
unexpectedly. If an HA-enabled Instance is shut down from inside the Instance,
CloudStack will restart it. To shut down an HA-enabled Instance, you must go
through the Zergaw CloudStack UI or API.
