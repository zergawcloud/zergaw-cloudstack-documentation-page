Working with ISOs
===================

Zergaw CloudStack supports ISOs and their attachment to Guest Instances. An ISO is a
read-only file that has an ISO/CD-ROM style file system. Users can
upload their own ISOs and mount them on their Guest Instances.

ISOs are uploaded based on a URL. HTTP is the supported protocol. Once
the ISO is available via HTTP specify an upload URL such as
http://my.web.server/filename.iso.

ISO images may be stored in the system and made available with a privacy
level similar to Templates. ISO images are classified as either bootable
or not bootable. A bootable ISO image is one that contains an OS image.
Zergaw CloudStack allows a User to boot a Guest Instance off of an ISO image. Users
can also attach ISO images to Guest Instances. For example, this enables
installing PV or virtio drivers. ISO images are not
hypervisor-specific.


Adding an ISO
-------------

To make additional operating system or other software available for use
with Guest Instances, you can add an ISO. The ISO is typically thought of as
an operating system image, but you can also add ISOs for other types of
software, such as desktop applications that you want to be installed as
part of a Template.

#. Log in to the UI as an administrator or end User.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Templates.

#. In Select View, choose ISOs.

#. Click Add ISO.

#. In the Add ISO screen, provide the following:

   -  **Name**: Short name for the ISO image. For example, CentOS 6.2
      64-bit.

   -  **Description**: Display test for the ISO image. For example,
      CentOS 6.2 64-bit.

   -  **URL**: The URL that hosts the ISO image. The Management Server
      must be able to access this location via HTTP. If needed you can
      place the ISO image directly on the Management Server

   -  **Zone**: Choose the zone where you want the ISO to be available

   -  **Bootable**: Whether or not a guest could boot off this ISO
      image. For example, a CentOS ISO is bootable, a Microsoft Office
      ISO is not bootable.

   -  **OS Type**: This helps the hypervisor perform
      certain operations and make assumptions that improve the
      performance of the guest. Select one of the following.

      -  If the operating system of your desired ISO image is listed,
         choose it.

      -  If the OS Type of the ISO is not listed or if the ISO is not
         bootable, choose Other.

      .. note::
         It is not recommended to choose an older version of the OS than
         the version in the image. For example, choosing CentOS 5.4 to
         support a CentOS 6.2 image will usually not work. In these
         cases, choose Other.

   -  **Extractable**: Choose Yes if the ISO should be available for
      extraction.

   -  **Public**: Choose Yes if this ISO should be available to other
      Users.

   -  **Arch**: The supported arch types are listed. Select the desired one.

#. Click OK.

   The Management Server will download the ISO. Depending on the size of
   the ISO, this may take a long time. The ISO status column will
   display Ready once it has been successfully downloaded into secondary
   storage. Clicking Refresh updates the download percentage.

#. **Important**: Wait for the ISO to finish downloading. If you move on
   to the next task and try to use the ISO right away, it will appear to
   fail.
