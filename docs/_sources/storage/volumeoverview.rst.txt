Volume Overview
--------------------

A volume provides storage to a Guest Instance. The volume can provide for a
root disk or an additional data disk.

Zergaw CloudStack defines a volume as a unit of storage available to a Guest
Instance. Volumes are either root disks or data disks. The root disk has "/"
in the file system and is usually the boot device. Data disks provide
for additional storage, for example: "/opt" or "D:". Every Guest Instance has
a root disk, and Instances can also optionally have a data disk. End Users can
mount multiple data disks to Guest Instances. Users choose data disks from the
disk offerings created by administrators. The User can create a Template
from a volume as well; this is the standard procedure for private
Template creation.
