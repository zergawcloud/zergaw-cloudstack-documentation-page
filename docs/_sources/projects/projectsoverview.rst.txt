Overview of Projects
--------------------

Projects are used to organize people and resources. Users
within a single domain can group themselves into project teams so they
can collaborate and share virtual resources such as Instances, Snapshots,
Templates, data disks, and IP addresses.

Once you have created a project, you become that project’s administrator, and
you can add others within your domain to the project. Zergaw CloudStack can be
set up to add more people directly to a project. Project members can view
and manage all virtual resources created by anyone in the project
(for example, share Instances). A User can be a member of any number of projects
and can switch views in the CloudStack UI to show only project-related information,
such as project Instances, fellow project members, project-related alerts, and so on.

It is possible for a project to have
multiple project administrators and to add specific Users of
an Account to a project in addition to adding Accounts. By means of
Project Roles associated with a User or an Account of the project,
it is possible to restrict access of Users in a project, i.e., in
addition to Account-level roles, one can further restrict access to
operations (or APIs) by associating a project-level role to the
User or Account. However, if an Account has already been added, one will not
be able to associate a role to a specific User of that Account.

**NOTE:** Project Roles work over Account level Roles. If a User/Account is
added to a project without a project role, it would imply that the
User / Account added will have access to all APIs that are made available
by the Account level role. If there are no specific deny rules in the
project role, it would again fallback onto the Account-level role to decide
whether the User has permissions to perform a specific action. It is also to be
noted that Project roles are restrictive in nature, i.e., to say that, one may
not allow a User to perform an operation that is NOT allowed at the Account level.
Even if a rule is added at the project level, allowing such an action, it will not
have any effect as the action will be prohibited by the Account Role.


The project administrator can promote or demote a User in the project.
The project administrator can also add more members, remove members
from the project, set new resource limits (as long as they are
below the global defaults set by the CloudStack administrator), and
delete the project. When the administrator removes a member from the
project, resources created by that User, such as Instances, remain
with the project. This brings us to the subject of resource ownership
and which resources can be used by a project.

Resources created within a project are owned by the project, not by any
particular Account, and they can be used only within the
project. A User who belongs to one or more projects can still create
resources outside of those projects, and those resources belong to the
User’s Account; they will not be counted against the project’s usage or
resource limits. You can create project-level networks to isolate
traffic within the project and provide network services such as port
forwarding, load balancing, VPN, and static NAT. A project can also make
use of certain types of resources from outside the project, if those
resources are shared. For example, a shared network or public Template
is available to any project in the domain. A project can get access to a
private Template if the Template’s owner will grant permission. A
project can use any service offering or disk offering available in its
domain; however, you can not create private service and disk offerings
at the project level.
