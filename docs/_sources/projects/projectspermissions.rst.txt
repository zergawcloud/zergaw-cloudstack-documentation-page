Project Permissions
---------------------

Adding Members to a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New members can be added to a project by the projectâ€™s administrator,
the domain administrator of the domain where the project resides. 
You can add members directly through the UI.


Working with Project Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zergaw CloudStack allows adding project members with a desired project role. A
project role will be assigned to the member in addition to their base
account role. Project Roles are restrictive in nature and can be used to
further restrict certain API access to the members within the project.
It is important to note that a project role cannot be used to elevate an
existing user's permissions. Project roles can be created or managed
using `Project roles` tab in the project details UI.


Adding Project Members From the UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps below tell how to add a new member to a project.

#. Log in to the CloudStack UI.

#. In the left navigation, click Projects.

#. Click the name of the project you want to work with.

#. Click on the `Add Account to Project` button. This will have 2 tabs, one to add Account to the project and the other to add a User to the project. Here, we can specify the:

      - Account or User and/or email id of the User to be invited,
      - (Optional) the Role i.e, Admin or Regular that the User is to be added as, defaults to Regular role,
      - (Optional) the Project role specifying the list of APIs the User is allowed/ denied access to

#. You can add only people who have an Account in this cloud and within the same domain as the project.
