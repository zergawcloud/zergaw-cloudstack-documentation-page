Managing Projects
--------------------

Setting Resource Limits for Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administrator can set global default limits to control
the amount of resources that can be owned by each project in the cloud.
This serves to prevent uncontrolled usage of resources such as
Snapshots, IP addresses, and Instances. Domain administrators can override
these resource limits for individual projects with their domains,
as long as the new limits are below the global defaults set by the
root administrator. The root administrator can also set lower resource limits
for any project in the cloud.

Setting Per-Project Resource Limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Domain administrator of the
domain where the project resides can set new resource limits for an
individual project. The project owner can set resource limits only if
the owner is also a domain or root administrator.

The new limits must be below the global default limits set by the administrator (as described in `“Setting
Resource Limits for Projects” <#setting-resource-limits-for-projects>`_).
If the project already owns more of a given type of resource than the
new maximum, the resources are not affected; however, the project can
not add any new resources of that type until the total drops below the
new limit.

#. Log in as administrator to the UI.

#. In the left navigation, click Projects.

#. Click the name of the project you want to work with.

#. Click the Resources tab. This tab lists the current maximum amount
   that the project is allowed to own for each type of resource.

#. Type new values for one or more resources.

#. Click Apply.


Creating a New Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Domain administrators can create projects.

#. Log in as administrator to the UI.

#. In the left navigation, click Projects.

#. Click New Project.

#. Give the project a name and description for display to Users, then
   click Create Project.

#. A screen appears where you can immediately add more members to the
   project. This is optional. Click Next when you are ready to move on.

#. Click Save.

Using the Project View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a member of a project, you can use the project view
to see project members, resources consumed, and more. The project view
shows only information related to one project. It is a useful way to
filter out other information so you can concentrate on a project status
and resources.

#. Log in to the UI.

#. Click Project View.

#. The project dashboard appears, showing the project’s Instances, volumes,
   Users, events, network settings, and more. From the dashboard, you
   can:

   -  Click the Accounts tab to view and manage project members. If you
      are the project administrator, you can add new members, remove
      members, or change the role of a member from User to admin or vice versa.

Suspending or Deleting a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a project is suspended, it retains the resources it owns, but they
can no longer be used. No new resources or members can be added to a
suspended project.

When a project is deleted, its resources are destroyed, and member
Accounts are removed from the project. The project’s status is shown as
Disabled pending final deletion.

A project can be suspended or deleted by the project administrator, the
domain administrator of the domain the project belongs to or of its
parent domain, or the root administrator.

#. Log in to the UI.

#. In the left navigation, click Projects.

#. Click the name of the project.

#. Click one of the buttons:

   To delete, use |Removes a project|

   To suspend, use |Suspends a project|
