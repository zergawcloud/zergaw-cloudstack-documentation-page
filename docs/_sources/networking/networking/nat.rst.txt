IP Forwarding
---------------

Source NAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A port forward service is a set of port forwarding rules that define a
policy. A port forward service is then applied to one or more Guest Instances.
The Guest Instance then has its inbound network access managed according to
the policy defined by the port forwarding service. You can optionally
specify one or more CIDRs to filter the source IPs. This is useful when
you want to allow only incoming requests from certain IP addresses to be
forwarded.

A Guest Instance can be in any number of port forward services. Port forward
services can be defined but have no members. If a Guest Instance is part of
more than one network, port forwarding rules will function only if they
are defined on the default network

You cannot use port forwarding to open ports for an elastic IP address.
When elastic IP is used, outside access is instead controlled through
the use of security groups. See Security Groups.

To set up port forwarding:

#. Log in to the UI as an administrator or end user.

#. In the left navigation bar, click Network.

#. Click the name of the guest network where the instances are running.

#. Choose an existing IP address or acquire a new IP address. See
   `"Acquiring a New IP Address" <#acquiring-a-new-ip-address>`_.
   Click the name of the IP address in the list.

#. Click the Port Forwarding tab.

#. Fill in the following:

   -  **Public Port**: The port to which public traffic will be
      addressed on the IP address you acquired in the previous step.

   -  **Private Port**: The port on which the instance is listening for
      forwarded public traffic.

   -  **Protocol**: The communication protocol in use between the two
      ports

#. Click Add.

Static NAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A static NAT rule maps a public IP address to the private IP address of
an instance in order to allow Internet traffic into the instance. The public IP
address always remains the same, which is why it is called static NAT.
This section tells how to enable or disable static NAT for a particular
IP address.


Enabling or Disabling Static NAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If port forwarding rules are already in effect for an IP address, you
cannot enable static NAT to that IP.

If a Guest Instance is part of more than one network, static NAT rules will
function only if they are defined on the default network.

#. Log in to the UI as an administrator or end user.

#. In the left navigation, choose Network.

#. Click the name of the network where you want to work with.

#. Click Public IP Addresses.

#. Click the IP address you want to work with.

#. Click the Static NAT |enabledisablenat.png| button.

   The button toggles between Enable and Disable, depending on whether
   static NAT is currently enabled for the IP address.

#. If you are enabling static NAT, a dialog appears where you can choose
   the destination instance and click Apply.
