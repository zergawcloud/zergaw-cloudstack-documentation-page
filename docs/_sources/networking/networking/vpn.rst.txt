Remote Access VPN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zergaw CloudStack Account owners can create virtual private networks (VPN) to
access their Instances. If the guest network is instantiated from
a network offering that offers the Remote Access VPN service, the
virtual router (based on the System VM) is used to provide the service.
Zergaw CloudStack provides a L2TP-over-IPsec-based remote access VPN service to
guest virtual networks. Since each network gets its own virtual router,
VPNs are not shared across the networks. VPN clients native to `Windows,
Mac OS X <networking/using_remote_access.html>`_ and iOS can be used to connect to the guest networks. The
account owner can create and manage users for their VPN.

.. note::
   Make sure that not all traffic goes through the VPN. That is, the route
   installed by the VPN should be only for the guest network and not for
   all traffic.

-  **Road Warrior / Remote Access**. Users want to be able to connect
   securely from a home or office to a private network in the cloud.
   Typically, the IP address of the connecting client is dynamic and
   cannot be preconfigured on the VPN server.

-  **Site to Site**. In this scenario, two private subnets are connected
   over the public Internet with a secure VPN tunnel. The cloud user's
   subnet (for example, an office network) is connected through a
   gateway to the network in the cloud. The address of the user's
   gateway must be preconfigured on the VPN server in the cloud. Note
   that although L2TP-over-IPsec can be used to set up Site-to-Site
   VPNs, this is not the primary intent of this feature. For more
   information, see ":ref:`setting-s2s-vpn-conn`".

Site-to-Site VPN 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Site-to-Site VPN connection helps you establish a secure connection
from an enterprise datacenter to the cloud infrastructure. This allows
users to access the Guest Instances by establishing a VPN connection to the
virtual router of the account from a device in the datacenter of the
enterprise. You can also establish a secure connection between two VPC
setups or high availability zones in your environment. Having this
facility eliminates the need to establish VPN connections to individual
instances.

The difference from Remote VPN is that Site-to-site VPNs connects entire
networks to each other, for example, connecting a branch office network
to a company headquarters network. In a site-to-site VPN, hosts do not
have VPN client software; they send and receive normal TCP/IP traffic
through a VPN gateway.

To set up a Site-to-Site VPN connection, perform the following:

#. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

   See ":ref:`configuring-vpc`".

#. Create a VPN Customer Gateway.

#. Create a VPN gateway for the VPC that you created.

#. Create VPN connection from the VPC VPN gateway to the customer VPN
   gateway.


Creating and Updating a VPN Customer Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   A VPN customer gateway can be connected to only one VPN gateway at a time.

To add a VPN Customer Gateway:

#. Log in to the UI as an administrator or end user.

#. In the left navigation, choose Network.

#. In the Select view, select VPN Customer Gateway.

#. Click Add VPN Customer Gateway.

   |addvpncustomergateway.png|

   Provide the following information:

   -  **Name**: A unique name for the VPN customer gateway you create.

   -  **Gateway**: The IP address for the remote gateway.

   -  **CIDR list**: The guest CIDR list of the remote subnets. Enter a
      CIDR or a comma-separated list of CIDRs. Ensure that a guest CIDR
      list is not overlapped with the VPC's CIDR, or another guest CIDR.
      The CIDR must be RFC1918-compliant.

   -  **IPsec Preshared Key**: Preshared keying is a method where the
      endpoints of the VPN share a secret key. This key value is used to
      authenticate the customer gateway and the VPC VPN gateway to each
      other. The sequence cannot contain a newline or double-quote.

      .. note::
         The IKE peers (VPN end points) authenticate each other by
         computing and sending a keyed hash of data that includes the
         Preshared key. If the receiving peer is able to create the same
         hash independently by using its Preshared key, it knows that both
         peers must share the same secret, thus authenticating the customer
         gateway.

   -  **IKE Encryption**: The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) policy for
      phase-1. The supported encryption algorithms are AES128, AES192,
      AES256, and 3DES. Authentication is accomplished through the
      Preshared Keys.

      .. note::
         The phase-1 is the first phase in the IKE process. In this initial
         negotiation phase, the two VPN endpoints agree on the methods to
         be used to provide security for the underlying IP traffic. The
         phase-1 authenticates the two VPN gateways to each other, by
         confirming that the remote gateway has a matching Preshared Key.

   -  **IKE Hash**: The IKE hash for phase-1. The supported hash
      algorithms are SHA1 and MD5.

   -  **IKE DH**: A public-key cryptography protocol which allows two
      parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure
      communications channel. The 1536-bit Diffie-Hellman group is used
      within IKE to establish session keys. The supported options are
      None, Group-5 (1536-bit) and Group-2 (1024-bit).

   -  **ESP Encryption**: Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) algorithm
      within phase-2. The supported encryption algorithms are AES128,
      AES192, AES256, and 3DES.

      .. note::
         The phase-2 is the second phase in the IKE process. The purpose of
         IKE phase-2 is to negotiate IPSec security associations (SA) to
         set up the IPSec tunnel. In phase-2, new keying material is
         extracted from the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in phase-1, to
         provide session keys to use in protecting the VPN data flow.

   -  **ESP Hash**: Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) hash for
      phase-2. Supported hash algorithms are SHA1 and MD5.

   -  **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Perfect Forward Secrecy (or PFS) is
      the property that ensures that a session key derived from a set of
      long-term public and private keys will not be compromised. This
      property enforces a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It provides
      the keying material that has greater key material life and thereby
      greater resistance to cryptographic attacks. The available options
      are None, Group-5 (1536-bit) and Group-2 (1024-bit). The security
      of the key exchanges increase as the DH groups grow larger, as
      does the time of the exchanges.

      .. note::
         When PFS is turned on, for every negotiation of a new phase-2 SA
         the two gateways must generate a new set of phase-1 keys. This
         adds an extra layer of protection that PFS adds, which ensures if
         the phase-2 SA's have expired, the keys used for new phase-2 SA's
         have not been generated from the current phase-1 keying material.

   -  **IKE Lifetime (seconds)**: The phase-1 lifetime of the security
      association in seconds. Default is 86400 seconds (1 day). Whenever
      the time expires, a new phase-1 exchange is performed.

   -  **ESP Lifetime (seconds)**: The phase-2 lifetime of the security
      association in seconds. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour). Whenever
      the value is exceeded, a re-key is initiated to provide a new
      IPsec encryption and authentication session keys.

   -  **Dead Peer Detection**: A method to detect an unavailable
      Internet Key Exchange (IKE) peer. Select this option if you want
      the virtual router to query the liveliness of its IKE peer at
      regular intervals. It's recommended to have the same configuration
      of DPD on both side of VPN connection.

   -  **Force UDP Encapsulation of ESP Packets**: Force Encapsulation for
      NAT traversal

#. Click OK.

   waits for the other VPC virtual router to initiate the connection. Do
   not select Passive on the VPC virtual router that initiates the
   connection.

#. Click OK to confirm.

   Within a few moments, the VPN Connection is displayed.

   The following information on the VPN connection is displayed:

   -  IP Address

   -  Gateway

   -  State

Site-to-Site VPN Connection Between VPC Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Zergaw CloudStack provides you with the ability to establish a site-to-site VPN
connection between different VPCs. To achieve that, add a
passive mode Site-to-Site VPN. With this functionality, users can deploy
applications in multiple Availability Zones or VPCs, which can
communicate with each other by using a secure Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel.

#. Create two VPCs. For example, VPC A and VPC B.

   For more information, see ":ref:`configuring-vpc`".

#. Create VPN gateways on both the VPCs you created.

   For more information, see `"Creating a VPN gateway
   for the VPC" <#creating-a-vpn-gateway-for-the-vpc>`_.

#. Create VPN customer gateway for both the VPCs.

   For more information, see `"Creating and Updating
   a VPN Customer Gateway" <#creating-and-updating-a-vpn-customer-gateway>`_.

#. Enable a VPN connection on VPC A in passive mode.

   For more information, see `"Creating a VPN
   Connection" <#creating-a-vpn-connection>`_.

   Ensure that the customer gateway is pointed to VPC B. The VPN
   connection is shown in the Disconnected state.

#. Enable a VPN connection on VPC B.

   Ensure that the customer gateway is pointed to VPC A. Because virtual
   router of VPC A, in this case, is in passive mode and is waiting for
   the virtual router of VPC B to initiate the connection, VPC B virtual
   router should not be in passive mode.

   The VPN connection is shown in the Disconnected state.

   Creating VPN connection on both the VPCs initiates a VPN connection.
   Wait for few seconds. The default is 30 seconds for both the VPN
   connections to show the Connected state.
