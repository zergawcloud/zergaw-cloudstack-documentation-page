IP Load Balancing
-----------------

The user may choose to associate the same public IP for multiple guests.
Zergaw CloudStack implements a TCP-level load balancer with the following
policies.

-	Round-robin

-	Least connection

-	Source IP

This is similar to port forwarding but the destination may be multiple
IP addresses.
