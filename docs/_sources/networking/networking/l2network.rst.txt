L2 (Layer 2) Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

L2 networks provide network isolation without any other services.  This
means that there will be no virtual router.  It is assumed that the end
user will have their own IPAM in place, or that they will statically assign
IP addresses.

-  L2 networks can be created by the end users, however network offerings
   which allow the network creator to specify a VLAN can only be created
   by the root admins.

-  CloudStack does not assign IP addresses to instances.

-  Userdata and metadata can be passed to the instance using a config drive
   (which must be enabled in the network service offering)

Example GUI dialog box (for a regular user account) is shown below:
