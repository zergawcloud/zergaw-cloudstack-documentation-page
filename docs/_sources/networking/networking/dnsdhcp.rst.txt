DNS and DHCP
------------

The Virtual Router & ConfigDrive provides
DNS and DHCP services to the guests. It proxies DNS requests to the DNS
server configured on the Availability Zone.

.. note::
   In case of a network with ConfigDrive, adding/removing nic to/from an
   instance or updating the ip address of a nic will not be reflected in the
   instance if the instance is already running. To do so, run
   `cloud-init clean --machine-id -s` to clean the machine id and seed data.
   Then reboot the instance to apply the changes.
