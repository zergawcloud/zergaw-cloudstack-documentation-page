Overview of Virtual Networks
-------------------------------------------

People using cloud infrastructure have a variety of needs and
preferences when it comes to the networking services provided by the
cloud.

A virtual network is a logical construct that enables multi-tenancy on a
single physical network. In Zergaw CloudStack a virtual network is isolated.

When you define a new virtual network, all your settings for that
network are stored in Zergaw CloudStack. The actual network resources are
activated only when the first Instance starts in the network.
When all Instances have left the virtual network, the network
resources are garbage collected so they can be allocated again. This
helps to conserve network resources.
