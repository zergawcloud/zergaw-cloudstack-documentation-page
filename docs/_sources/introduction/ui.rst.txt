User Interface
------------------

Zergaw CloudStack provides a web-based UI that can be used by both
administrators and end Users. The UI is
available in all modern popular browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and
Safari. The UI uses API auto-discovery to discover APIs allowed for a logged-in
User and creates navigation and views based on that, and requires the following:

- API discovery (listApis) enabled for all roles that must use the UI
- Modern browsers that are `ES5-compliant <https://github.com/vuejs/vue#browser-compatibility>`_
