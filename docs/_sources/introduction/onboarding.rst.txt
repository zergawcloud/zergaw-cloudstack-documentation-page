Onboarding
-----------

Zergaw CloudStack provides a seamless onboarding experience that allows customers 
to quickly access and manage their cloud infrastructure. There are currently two 
main ways to acquire an account on the Zergaw CloudStack IaaS platform, through 
our automated billing portal or via manual registration with our sales and customer 
support team.

Onboarding via the Billing Portal
==================================

Customers can sign up through our billing portal to create and manage their 
cloud resource allocations. To get started, users need to register an account on 
the billing portal and complete the KYC verification process. Once the account is 
verified, customers can browse a variety of compute, storage, and network offerings 
to design their desired cloud infrastructure and add the selected resources to 
their cart. After completing the checkout process, the system automatically 
provisions a dedicated tenant on the Zergaw CloudStack IaaS platform and sends 
the customer their login credentials via email and SMS. This automated workflow ensures 
a fast, transparent, and fully self-service onboarding experience.

Onboarding via our Support Team
================================

Alternatively, customers can acquire a tenant on the Zergaw CloudStack IaaS platform 
through manual account creation. To do this, customers may contact our support team 
via their preferred communication channel and request a quotation for their desired 
resource requirements. Once the order is confirmed and payment is completed, a 
dedicated tenant will be provisioned on the platform. The access credentials 
and related information will then be securely shared with the customer. 
This process ensures that organizations with specific or custom needs can still be 
onboarded efficiently while receiving personalized assistance from our team.
