About Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To increase reliability of the cloud, resources are grouped
into multiple geographic regions. A region is the largest available
organizational unit within a Zergaw CloudStack deployment. A region is made up
of several availability zones, where each zone is roughly equivalent to
a datacenter. Regions are a useful
technique for providing fault tolerance and disaster recovery.

.. note::
   Currently Zergaw Cloudstack has one region operating in Ethiopia.

About Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~

A zone is the second largest organizational unit within a Zergaw CloudStack
deployment. A zone typically corresponds to a single datacenter,
although it is permissible to have multiple zones in a datacenter. The
benefit of organizing infrastructure into zones is to provide physical
isolation and redundancy. For example, each zone can have its own power
supply and network uplink, and the zones can be widely separated
geographically (though this is not required).

A zone consists of:

-  One or more pods. Each pod contains one or more clusters of hosts and
   one or more primary storage servers.

-  A zone may contain one or more primary storage servers, which are
   shared by all the pods in the zone.

-  Secondary storage, which is shared by all the pods in the zone.

Zones are visible to the end user. When a user starts a Guest Instance, the
user must select a zone for their guest. Users might also be required to
copy their private Templates to additional zones to enable creation of
Guest Instances using their Templates in those zones.

Zones can be public or private. Public zones are visible to all users.
This means that any user may create a guest in that zone. Private zones
are reserved for a specific domain. Only users in that domain or its
subdomains may create guests in that zone.

Hosts in the same zone are directly accessible to each other without
having to go through a firewall. Hosts in different zones can access
each other through statically configured VPN tunnels.

.. _about-pods:

About Pods
~~~~~~~~~~

A pod often represents a single rack. Hosts in the same pod are in the
same subnet. A pod is the third-largest organizational unit within a
Zergaw CloudStack deployment. Pods are contained within zones. Each zone can
contain one or more pods. A pod consists of one or more clusters of
hosts and one or more primary storage servers. Pods are not visible to
the end user.

.. _about-clusters:

About Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A cluster provides a way to group hosts. To be precise, a cluster is a
XenServer server pool, a set of KVM servers or a VMware cluster
preconfigured in vCenter. The hosts in a cluster all have identical
hardware, run the same hypervisor, are on the same subnet, and access
the same shared primary storage. Instances can be live-migrated from
one host to another within the same cluster, without interrupting service
to the user.

A cluster is the fourth-largest organizational unit within a Zergaw CloudStack
deployment. Clusters are contained within pods, and pods are contained
within zones.

.. _about-hosts:

About Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~

A host is a single server. Hosts provide the computing resources that
run Guest Instances. Each host has hypervisor software installed
on it to manage the Guest Instances. For example, a host can be a Citrix
XenServer server, a Linux KVM-enabled server, an ESXi server, or a
Windows Hyper-V server.

The host is the smallest organizational unit within a Zergaw CloudStack
deployment. Hosts are contained within clusters, clusters are contained
within pods, pods are contained within zones, and zones can be contained
within regions.

Hosts in a Zergaw CloudStack deployment:

-  Provide the CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources needed to
   host the Instances

-  Interconnect using a high bandwidth TCP/IP network and connect to the
   Internet

-  May reside in multiple data centers across different geographic
   locations

-  May have different capacities (different CPU speeds, different
   amounts of RAM, etc.), although the hosts within a cluster must all
   be homogeneous

Additional hosts can be added at any time to provide more capacity for
Guest Instances.

Zergaw CloudStack automatically detects the amount of CPU and memory resources
provided by the hosts.

Hosts are not visible to the end user. An end user cannot determine
which host their guest has been assigned to.

About Primary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primary storage is associated with a cluster, and it stores
virtual disks for all the Instances running on hosts in that cluster.

About Secondary Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secondary storage stores the following:

-  Templates — OS images that can be used to boot Instances and can include
   additional configuration information, such as installed applications

-  ISO images — disc images containing data or bootable media for
   operating systems

-  Disk Volume Snapshots — saved copies of Instance data which can be used for
   data recovery or to create new Templates

.. _about-object-storage:

About Object Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Object storage (also known as object-based storage) is a data storage that manages data as objects.
Users can create buckets within the object storage pool.
The basic storage units of Object Store are objects. Any type of data, regardless of content type, is stored as an object.
Buckets are logical containers for storing objects.

About Shared FileSystems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zergaw CloudStack users can setup managed Shared FileSystems which can be mounted via NFS.
Users can choose the service offering, disk offering, filesystem format and network.
The Shared FileSystem is deployed on an Instance with the specified service offering.
A data volume is created using the given disk offering and attached to the Instance.
User can specify which filesystem to use (XFS, EXT4).
The filesystem is created on the data volume and exported via NFS.
All Instances in the guest network can mount and read/write to the Shared FileSystem.
